    <p>CodeHax - A youth organization dedicated to providing youth with computer science opportunities.</p>
    <p>Hi there! CodeHax is a student led organization based in the GTA in Ontario, Canada, but with members from across North America. Our goal is to provide computer science opportunities through online lessons and hackathons. We are extremely passionate in computer science and would like to inspire others and encourage youth to explore the various fields of technology. We are currently creating and publishing lessons where we teach the basics of Java on our Youtube channel Code Hax. In addition, our team is working on planning a virtual hackathon in September 2021, and will continue to plan future in-person/online hackathons and workshops. Please join us in helping aspiring young innovators explore their passions in technology!</p>
